# Improving and evaluating Pastry implementations in DistAlgo
<https://sites.google.com/a/stonybrook.edu/sbcs535/projects/pastry-distalgo>

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
There are various implementations of Pastry present in different languages on
the web but we couldnâ€™t find implementation of Pastry in DistAlgo. So we plan to
implement Pastry in DistAlgo as per (Antony Rowstron et al.) and try to come
with optimized implementation by comparing, improving and evaluating other
implementations. Our goal is to find and report errors in the previous
implementations and implement a bug-free optimized version in DistAlgo.

The document gives high level design of the API functionalitites for design and
implementation of Pastry : Scalable, decentralized object location and routing
for large-scale peer-to-peer systems. This document higlights the modules,
classes and data associated. It contains the flow-chart for Pastry core routing
algorithm from the paper
https://www.cs.rice.edu/~druschel/publications/Pastry.pdf.

Please refer to the Documents directory for Project Proposal, Design Document
and Final Project report. The flow chart and pseudo-code is also present in the
documents directory itself.
